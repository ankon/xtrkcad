# XTrackCAD Changelog #

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
+ Page positions can be shown on the center of each printed page.
+ A new type of note can be used to store a weblink. Double-clicking on the
weblink icon in a drawing opens the website in the default browser.
+ Usabillity / compatibility of parameter files for current scale and gauge is
shown in the parameter file dialog.
+ Additional enhanced file format .xtce allows storing background image and
related information with the trackplan.

### Fixed

### Added and changed parameter files
+ Prototype definitions for North American narrow gauge
+ Blackstone and Rail Line car parts for HOn3

## [5.1.2]

### Added
+ Make Debug menu both work and do something useful
This menu in Options->Debug only appears if the env variable XTRKCADEXTRA is set A "Loosen" command also appears in Modify when set.The Debug window lists any Logging entries (set with "-d loggingname=level" parms).For example, "-d trainMove=5 -d traverseCornu=2" sets two Loglines - one at level 5 and the other 2. The value of the level can be adjusted in the Debug window and then the button "OK" sets it.Given that a level value of 0 means no logging for that logging variable, this menu allows log/tracing to be adjusted on the fly after startup.
Debug Window has a default trace level option. This is the level of Log/Trace that all types of tracing will follow unless they have been specified explicitly in the startup parms or otherwise.
Any log entries created before the first invocation of the window will be included, so a tester could add a LogSet("traverseBezier",0) line into the InitTrkBezier() code while testing or use a -d traverseBezier=0 and then use Debug to set level to 1 and start logging.

### Fixed
+ Make Up and Down Scroll only move 1/2 a screen height (rather than 1/2 a width)
+ Fix Modify redraw for Bezier or Cornu
+ Allow modify of naked Cornu along the Cornu itself if it isn't connected to another Cornu or Bezier
+ Fix Abend on extend of naked Cornu
+ Make sure Flip Cornu produces a correct relationship between ends and Bezier segments
+ Fix Traverse Cornu for case where there are multiple sub-segments within a Bezier segment
+ Remove UndoModify from low-level functions - to ensure that they can't be called without a preceding UndoStart and cause error messages
+ Description: correct include tag for Linux
+ Fix possible error when Cloning Structures or Turnouts  
+ Fix bad test for RescaleTrack and no test for RotateTrack.
+ Fix the Modify Polygon Undo problem
+ Fix memory bug when flipping a Polygon
+ Stop Connect always logging without being initialized and fix message if logging is initialized
+ Fix memory violations when logging
+ Fix Double Track components so Train will work properly
+ Improved German translations
+ Include StringLimit code to stop overwrites
+ Fix possible memory overrun when updating a car

### Added and changed parameter files
+ Parameter files TT Kuehn Peco HO US, Newqida G, Atlas N and Fasttrack Nn3 new or update
+ New parameter file for Weinert Mein Gleis
+ Update parameter file for Z-Rokuhan

## [5.1.1]

### Added

### Fixed
+ Change gtk print.c to use native dpi for real printers and only up def to 600 dpi for file outputs.
+ Fix runaway storage and long wait for Car Inventory->Add
+ Fix map window not resized for map scale change in GTK
+ Last uintptr_t replaced with uint32_t in param.c
+ Control limiting of entered string length with a special flag in paramData_t
+ Downgrade CMake version requirement to 2.8 for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 14.04.
+ Update print to reflect that GTK always uses PDF now.
+ Add fix for zoom grid performance from V5.2 to V5.1
+ Ensure that white (hidden) straight track segments get written out as white
+ Upgrade Map Icon
+ Add variable Print Override environment variables
XTRKCADPRINTSCALE=scale_factor
XTRKCADPRINTTEXTSCALE=text_factor
scale_factor is a floating point number is frequently 1.0 (if needed)
text_factor is a floating point number frequently 0.75 (if needed)
These variables are ignored if the print is to a file.
These seem most likely to result from Pango or other parts of the PDF chain to the printer being given bad DPI information which causes the scaling(s) to be inaccurate.
If there is enough use, we can add to the print dialog itself.
+ Fix crash when changing the layer from the properties dialog of cornus
+ Fix Cornu Describe Abend when altering Layer.
+ Fix odd lost overlaid labels in Describe when lots of Positions are used
+ All: Check string length for all relevant PD_STRING entry fields
+ Windows: Always set color before drawing text
+ Make sure that Text Segs and Poly Segs copy string and Pts when UnGrouping. Stop weird results and Abends.
+ Make Cairo use pure RGB to retrieve the same color it stored for wDrawColor rather than ask for GDKï¿½s version (which might not be exact).
+ Fix Cornu Rate of Change of Curvature.
+ Fix situation where a Bezier or Cornu is modified when the scale  or gauge has since been set to a different value than the track to be modified. Remember the old track values.
+ Fix Abend on cornu Join to turntable, also make sure cornu Modify leaves more than minlength on connected tracks
+ Fix Abend on Describe or Delete of Compound with more than 4 end points (like a turntable)
+ Try to stop issues with F3 objects in Compounds.
+ Correctly process F segment records (i.e., no version).
+ Remove automatic word wrap in describe Text object, linefeeds can be edited manually
