## [5.1.2]

### Added
+ Make Debug menu both work and do something useful 
This menu in Options->Debug only appears if the env variable XTRKCADEXTRA is set A "Loosen" command also appears in Modify when set.The Debug window lists any Logging entries (set with "-d loggingname=level" parms).For example, "-d trainMove=5 -d traverseCornu=2" sets two Loglines - one at level 5 and the other 2. The value of the level can be adjusted in the Debug window and then the button "OK" sets it.Given that a level value of 0 means no logging for that logging variable, this menu allows log/tracing to be adjusted on the fly after startup.
Debug Window has a default trace level option. This is the level of Log/Trace that all types of tracing will follow unless they have been specified explicitly in the startup parms or otherwise.
Any log entries created before the first invocation of the window will be included, so a tester could add a LogSet("traverseBezier",0) line into the InitTrkBezier() code while testing or use a -d traverseBezier=0 and then use Debug to set level to 1 and start logging.

## Fixed

+ Fix Abend on extend of naked Cornu
+ Make sure Flip Cornu produces a correct relationship between ends and Bezier segments
+ Fix Traverse Cornu for case where there are multiple sub-segments within a Bezier segment 
+ Remove UndoModify from low-level functions - to ensure that they can't be called without a preceding UndoStart and cause error messages
+ Description: correct include tag for Linux
+ Fix possible error when Cloning Structures or Turnouts  
+ Fix bad test for RescaleTrack and no test for RotateTrack.

## [5.1.1]

### Added

### Fixed
+ Change gtk print.c to use native dpi for real printers and only up def to 600 dpi for file outputs.
+ Fix runaway storage and long wait for Car Inventory->Add
+ Fix map window not resized for map scale change in GTK
+ Last uintptr_t replaced with uint32_t in param.c
+ Control limiting of entered string length with a special flag in paramData_t
+ Downgrade CMake version requirement to 2.8 for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 14.04.
+ Update print to reflect that GTK always uses PDF now.
+ Add fix for zoom grid performance from V5.2 to V5.1
+ Ensure that white (hidden) straight track segments get written out as white
+ Upgrade Map Icon
+ Add variable Print Override environment variables
XTRKCADPRINTSCALE=scale_factor
XTRKCADPRINTTEXTSCALE=text_factor
scale_factor is a floating point number is frequently 1.0 (if needed)
text_factor is a floating point number frequently 0.75 (if needed)
These variables are ignored if the print is to a file.
These seem most likely to result from Pango or other parts of the PDF chain to the printer being given bad DPI information which causes the scaling(s) to be inaccurate.
If there is enough use, we can add to the print dialog itself.

+ Fix Cornu Describe Abend when altering Layer.
+ Fix odd lost overlaid labels in Describe when lots of Positions are used

+ Fix Abend on Describe or Delete of Compound with more than 4 end points (like a turntable)
+ Try to stop issues with F3 objects in Compounds.
