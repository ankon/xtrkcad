## [5.2.0]

### New and changed features

+ Add Join Line Command to create PolyLines from Straight, Bezier, Curved and PolyLines
+ countless internal changes were done to improve drawing performance and stability
+ Change Magnetic Snap reverse to be on the â€œAltâ€ key.
+ Added french translation for the UI, contributed by Jacques Glize
+ Windows: support for utf-8 character encoding in text fields, labels etc.
+ Add new options for SelectMode (Only, Add) and SelectZero (On, Off) to Options->Command.
+ Add regression testing when running demos
+ New Rotate Symbol during Rotate.
+ Profile window: fill color, label formating and positioning
+ Add PNG export for Windows using FreeImage
+ Apply rescale operation to background as well. When the scale,not the gauge, is changed, the background image is resized and repositioned to the same ratio.
+ Update demo files
+ Add the indexing and searching functions for parameter files
+ Add â€˜?â€™ as a means to jump to the properties screen in Select Mode
+ Update Layout File Version to V11 and minimum required version to V5.2.0
+ Add a new Parallel Track Radius Factor option to increase the separation of the parallel track based on Radius. The default value is 0.0 which is no increase. A value of 1.0 is set to be a prototype increase scaled as appropriate.  In OO this will add about 1.5â€ for a 24â€ radius.
+ Add support for dotted and dashed lines to Draw Objects
+ Set and un-set favorite property for parameter files

+ Snap Dimension lines to other objects (tracks of draw objects) regardless of Shift state
+ Add full Module support including documentation for modular layouts.
+ Add two extra track properties and Edit Commands for them - â€œBridgeâ€ - adds simple abutment symbol
â€œTies/No Tiesâ€ - hides Ties on a selected track even if zoomed in - this can be useful for dual gauge or in docks and goods yards, where the rails are inset into the ground.
+ Rename â€œAboveâ€ to â€œMove to Frontâ€ and â€œBelowâ€ to â€œMove to Backâ€ this has caused confusion in the past.
+ Allow Parallel separation of 0 when using different tracks gauges to produce overlaid tracks to simulate dual gauge.

## [5.1.2]

### Added
+ Make Debug menu both work and do something useful
This menu in Options->Debug only appears if the env variable XTRKCADEXTRA is set A "Loosen" command also appears in Modify when set.The Debug window lists any Logging entries (set with "-d loggingname=level" parms).For example, "-d trainMove=5 -d traverseCornu=2" sets two Loglines - one at level 5 and the other 2. The value of the level can be adjusted in the Debug window and then the button "OK" sets it.Given that a level value of 0 means no logging for that logging variable, this menu allows log/tracing to be adjusted on the fly after startup.
Debug Window has a default trace level option. This is the level of Log/Trace that all types of tracing will follow unless they have been specified explicitly in the startup parms or otherwise.
Any log entries created before the first invocation of the window will be included, so a tester could add a LogSet("traverseBezier",0) line into the InitTrkBezier() code while testing or use a -d traverseBezier=0 and then use Debug to set level to 1 and start logging.

### Fixed
+ Make Up and Down Scroll only move 1/2 a screen height (rather than 1/2 a width)
+ Fix Modify redraw for Bezier or Cornu
+ Allow modify of naked Cornu along the Cornu itself if it isn't connected to another Cornu or Bezier
+ Fix Abend on extend of naked Cornu
+ Make sure Flip Cornu produces a correct relationship between ends and Bezier segments
+ Fix Traverse Cornu for case where there are multiple sub-segments within a Bezier segment
+ Remove UndoModify from low-level functions - to ensure that they can't be called without a preceding UndoStart and cause error messages
+ Description: correct include tag for Linux
+ Fix possible error when Cloning Structures or Turnouts  
+ Fix bad test for RescaleTrack and no test for RotateTrack.
+ Fix the Modify Polygon Undo problem
+ Fix memory bug when flipping a Polygon
+ Stop Connect always logging without being initialized and fix message if logging is initialized
+ Fix memory violations when logging

## [5.1.1]

### Added

### Fixed
+ Change gtk print.c to use native dpi for real printers and only up def to 600 dpi for file outputs.
+ Fix runaway storage and long wait for Car Inventory->Add
+ Fix map window not resized for map scale change in GTK
+ Last uintptr_t replaced with uint32_t in param.c
+ Control limiting of entered string length with a special flag in paramData_t
+ Downgrade CMake version requirement to 2.8 for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 14.04.
+ Update print to reflect that GTK always uses PDF now.
+ Add fix for zoom grid performance from V5.2 to V5.1
+ Ensure that white (hidden) straight track segments get written out as white
+ Upgrade Map Icon
+ Add variable Print Override environment variables
XTRKCADPRINTSCALE=scale_factor
XTRKCADPRINTTEXTSCALE=text_factor
scale_factor is a floating point number is frequently 1.0 (if needed)
text_factor is a floating point number frequently 0.75 (if needed)
These variables are ignored if the print is to a file.
These seem most likely to result from Pango or other parts of the PDF chain to the printer being given bad DPI information which causes the scaling(s) to be inaccurate.
If there is enough use, we can add to the print dialog itself.
+ Fix crash when changing the layer from the properties dialog of cornus
+ Fix Cornu Describe Abend when altering Layer.
+ Fix odd lost overlaid labels in Describe when lots of Positions are used
+ All: Check string length for all relevant PD_STRING entry fields
+ Windows: Always set color before drawing text
+ Make sure that Text Segs and Poly Segs copy string and Pts when UnGrouping. Stop weird results and Abends.
+ Make Cairo use pure RGB to retrieve the same color it stored for wDrawColor rather than ask for GDKÃ¯Â¿Â½s version (which might not be exact).
+ Fix Cornu Rate of Change of Curvature.
+ Fix situation where a Bezier or Cornu is modified when the scale  or gauge has since been set to a different value than the track to be modified. Remember the old track values.
+ Fix Abend on cornu Join to turntable, also make sure cornu Modify leaves more than minlength on connected tracks
+ Fix Abend on Describe or Delete of Compound with more than 4 end points (like a turntable)
+ Try to stop issues with F3 objects in Compounds.
+ Correctly process F segment records (i.e., no version).
