\H{cmdDraw} \i{Draw Menu}

\e{Draw} commands are used to draw lines, arcs and other shapes. These can be used to represent water edges, bridges and other scenic features.

\G{png.d/bdraw.png}

There are 4 command buttons on the tool-bar used to draw Straight Objects, Curved Lines, Circles and other Shapes.  Each command button is followed by a button that changes the action (and Icon) on the command button.

\G{png.d/mdraw.png}

Functions for drawing basic shapes and objects like lines and curves can be accessed from this menu.

\dd \f{Circle Lines} - draw empty or filled circles. (\K{cmdDrawCircles})

\u000

\dd \f{Curved Lines} - are created in the same manner as curved tracks. (\K{cmdDrawCurves})

\u000

\dd \f{Note} - attach a note icon to a specific location on the layout. (\K{cmdNote})

\u000

\dd \f{Ruler} - create ruler and set visibility (\K{cmdRuler})

\u000

\dd \f{Protractor} - create protractor and set visibility (\K{cmdAngle})

\u000

\dd \f{Shapes} - draw boxes, polygons and poly-lines. (\K{cmdDrawShapes})

\u000

\dd \f{Straight Objects} - draw straight objects. (\K{cmdDrawStraight})

\u000

\dd \f{Text} - allows entry of text directly onto the layout. (\K{cmdText})

Some commands display controls on the Status Line (\K{mainW}) to change line width, color or other attributes of the object.

\S{cmdDrawCircles} Circles and Filled Circles

\G{png.d/mdrawcircles.png}

Before a Circle is drawn its line width and color can be set. For Filled Circles, the color can be set.
The \f{Circle Line Width} field is a scaled dimension in inches if >0. If 0 it is a 1 pixel wide line at all zooms. If the value is negative, it is a scale-independent number of pixels wide.

\f{Circles} and \f{Filled Circles} are created by selecting either the center position or a point on the edge of the circle and dragging to specify the radius.

\S{DrawOrigin} Draw Objects Origin

Some objects have a natural rotation point within them. By setting the origin to this point, subsequent rotation will be about that point and not the layout origin. 
This is referred to as a \e{Relative} origin. 
When one of these is moved or rotated, the origin and angle are adjusted but the relative draw point values remain the same.

You can choose to set the origin to make it Relative or put it back to Absolute during \K{cmdDrawShapes} or \K{cmdModify} or by using the \K{cmdDescribe} settings.  

As a practical matter, the object will appear identical until a subsequent rotation value is entered in the \K{cmdDescribe} window in both cases.

In Origin Mode (entered using \c{'o'} or the Context Menu, there are certain shortcuts available -

\dd \c{'p'} Go to Points Mode

\dd \c{'0'} Move to Absolute (Origin to 0,0)

\dd \c{'1-4'} Move the Relative Origin to the shape point 1 to 4

The \f{Text} command lets you enter text on the layout at the selected position. You can use the Tab key to format the text to fixed tab positions and CTRL+Enter to enter a newLine character.

\G{png.d/statustext.png}

The font size can be changed by the Font Size drop list on the \f{Status-bar} (\K{mainW}).  The font size is scaled along with everything else on the layout so text is always the same relative size as other layout objects.

The font can be selected by the \f{Font Selection} (\K{fontSelW}) dialog invoked by the \f{Options>Fonts} menu item or by \c{Shift+Right-Click} (\K{cmdAcclKeys}).

The position where text is to be placed on the layout must be selected prior to text entry. The position is select by \c{Left-Click}ing on the layout at the point where the text is to appear. Desired text is entered after the position is selected. If necessary, the location can be changed once text entry begins by \c{Left-Click+Drag}ing the text to any desired postion on the layout.

The \f{Properties} (\K{cmdDescribe}) command can be used to modify the contents of existing \f{Text} objects and to draw boxes around them.

Note: loading fonts (or changing sizes) can take a noticeable amount of time.
